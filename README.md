Expense Tracker API
A robust, test-driven RESTful API for tracking personal expenses. This project was built with Python and Django, following modern software engineering practices including Test-Driven Development (TDD), a Git feature-branch workflow, and a clean, scalable project structure.

Features
Expense Management: Create, view, update, and delete expenses.

Data Persistence: All expense data is stored in a database via the Django ORM.

Filtering: Retrieve expenses filtered by category or date range (to be implemented).

API Interface: All functionality is exposed through a well-defined RESTful API.

Tech Stack
Backend: Python, Django, Django REST Framework

Testing: Pytest, Pytest-Django

Code Quality: Black, Ruff

API Endpoints
The following endpoints are available:

Method  Endpoint  Description
GET /api/expenses/  Retrieve a list of all expenses.
POST  /api/expenses/  Create a new expense.

#### **2. Add In-Code Documentation with Docstrings**

While the `README` explains the project as a whole, **docstrings** explain individual pieces of your code (modules, classes, and functions). Following the official PEP 257 style guide for docstrings is a mark of a professional Python developer. [6]

Let's add a proper docstring to the `ExpenseViewSet` we created. Open `src/expense_tracker/core/views.py` and update it:

```python
# src/expense_tracker/core/views.py
from rest_framework import viewsets
from.models import Expense
from.serializers import ExpenseSerializer

class ExpenseViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    """
    A simple ViewSet for viewing and editing expenses.

    This ViewSet automatically provides `list`, `create`, `retrieve`,
    `update` and `destroy` actions.
    """
    queryset = Expense.objects.all()
    serializer_class = ExpenseSerializer
This multi-line docstring clearly explains the purpose of the class, making the code easier to understand for anyone who reads it.  Â  

3. Commit Your Documentation
Now, let's save our new documentation to Git.

Bash
# Add the new and modified files
git add README.md src/expense_tracker/core/views.py

# Commit with a conventional commit message
git commit -m "docs(project): add comprehensive README and viewset docstring"

# Push to your main branch on GitHub
git push origin main
